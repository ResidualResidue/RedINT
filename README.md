# RedINT
This is an OSINT tool meant for 

1) cybersecurity professionals to perform passive recon, and 
2) individuals to collect information on themselves in order to see how much unnecessary information they've put out publically.

Please don't be jackasses.

## How to Use

1) Make an account on Reddit that has a password (if you signed up through google, you will not have one)
2) Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and create an app. It can be any name.
3) Use your username, password, app secret, app ID, and app name in your config.py file
